- <b>Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?</b></br>
Looking at the dataset above, two of the five variables that provided the most non-random amount of variance were vehicle length with a p-value of 2.60e-12 and ground clearance at a p-value of 5.21e-08.


- <b>Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? </b></br>
No, the slope is not considered to be at zero as we can see with the vehicle length and ground clearance p-values are less than the significance level of 0.05.

- <b>Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?</b></br>
Yes, since the r-squared value is at 0.72, this is a good indicator that this linear model can predict mpg values effectively.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

<b>Total Summary</b> </br>
As the variance resulted at 62.29, it is less than 100 pounds per square inch. Therefore, this meets the manufacturing data design specification for all lots in total.

<b>Lot Summary</b> </br>
Lots 1 and 2 fit within the design specifications, but there is a major problem with Lot 3. It greatly exceeds the limit as it reached 170 PSI and does not meet the required 100 PSI to be considered within the design specification.
